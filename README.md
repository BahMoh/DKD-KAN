# DKD-KAN: Lightweight Intrusion Detection with Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks and Decoupled Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains the official implementation of our lightweight intrusion detection framework introduced in the paper:

> **"Lightweight Intrusion Detection Using Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks and Decoupled Knowledge Distillation"**

## ðŸš€ Overview

Cyber-security systems often operate in environments with limited resources, such as edge devices and real-time monitoring systems, where **model size** and **inference speed** are critical. To address these challenges, we propose a novel intrusion detection approach that combines:

- **Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN)**: A high-capacity teacher model that effectively captures complex patterns in attack data.
- **Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD)**: An efficient training strategy to transfer knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight student model.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Student**: A highly compact model with as few as **2,522 parameters (WADI)** and **1,622 parameters (SWaT)**, designed for deployment in constrained environments.

Despite their small size, our DKD-MLP models achieve strong performance, improving **F1-scores by 4.18% (SWaT)** and **3.07% (WADI)** over standard baselines.
